# Mechanical Moon - A Dev Blog

A tiny corner of the internet for little ol' me, developed using the [Astro](https://astro.build/) web framework. It's a personal site, a bit of work history and a dev blog!

## ðŸ§ž Astro Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
